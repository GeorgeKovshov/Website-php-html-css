What do you get when you combine a platformer with no jump button, a blaster used only to dig holes in the ground and enemies so dead-set on getting you that they forget to look what they are stepping onto? 
One of the absolute best puzzle platformers ever made.
Excellent controls, solid level design (presenting over a hundred different levels), relentless A.I. and a wonderfully retro, timeless presentation. The single biggest reason to get into Apple II emulation.
