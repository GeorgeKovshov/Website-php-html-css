The game that pushed the video game industry towards cinematic. It was the first to properly define the "feel" of a modern game with its blend of cutscenes that merge with the gameplay, and "outside-the-box" gameplay situations that turn a game into an experience akin to an interactive film. Call of Duty 4, Arkham Asylum, Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne, etc. - all have traces of MGS1 in their DNA.
Even though it's outshined by later games (some in the same series), it's still, very much, a brilliant game. The combination of definitive (and masterfully used) PS1 aesthetics, simplicity of its excellent gameplay and brevity of its jam-packed with memorable moments length come together into a truly timeless experience that, to my mind, only gets lessened by "updates" or "remakes".
