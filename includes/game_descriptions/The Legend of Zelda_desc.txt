I'd noticed that - when talking about Zelda series - the original game is often disregarded with the unspoken assumption that it is, obviously, dated. I don't really agree.
Sure, compared to other entries in the series it's not really a contender, but hell, Zelda features a NUMBER of games often considered the greatest of all time. Picking the best one can be as devilish a proposition as a question of: "which Bronte sister is the greatest author?" Sure, you can argue between Charlotte and Emily all you want, but don't disregard the talent of Anne while you're at it.
You see, the brilliance of original Zelda is in its simplicity. The coherence of its catchy 8-bit tunes, straightforward gameplay, minimalist visuals, stripped down story and addictiveness of the whole "guessing where the secrets are while slashing at enemies to grind for gold" comes in such a spectacular unison that - when I first played it in 2011 - I couldn't put the controller away until I'd completed it without a guide or a map.
Of course Link to the Past has iterated upon this one in every way... but in doing so it's altered the very nature of its experience. The reason I'd come to the first Zelda is fundamentally not the same as the one that would bring me to its sequels. In fact, there's no game in existence that delivers upon the promise of a pure retro gaming adventure quite as well as the first Legend of Zelda.
