Strategy games create elaborate systems of gameplay mechanics and require the player to use them effectively enough to overcome the presented obstacles. The challenge is to understand and master not just the surface level (how to control the game), but also hidden dynamics (which units are better against which, how to effectively manage resources, etc.). The core aim of this gameplay is to involve the player mentally into the game, making him think about his actions, plan and thus become lost in the gameplay experience. Key words: thinking, planning, tactics.
