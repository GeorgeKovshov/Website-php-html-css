Adventure, in video games, means puzzle solving. The game presents you with a situation (puzzle), the solution of which (most often a single one) is not immediately obvious, requiring you to solve it with the tools (most often inventory items) the game presents you with.
Itâ€™s illuminating to use strategy games when defining unique dynamic of adventure games. Both genres require the player to think, although, while strategy is open-ended and presents numerous pathways to victory, the adventure game is narrowed down and strict, requiring a particular solution to proceed. The difference between the two is, essentially, the leeway given to the player in terms of what the game accepts as a solution: the more strict the game is, the more it resembles an adventure game and less a strategy.
