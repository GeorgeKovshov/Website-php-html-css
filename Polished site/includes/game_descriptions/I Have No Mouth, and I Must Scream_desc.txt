It’s hard not to notice a game with a name like this. It’s even harder to live up to it, and for more reasons than one.
The short story this game is based on is often listed among the greatest of its genre and for a good reason. It depicts a world post A.I. singularity with AM, the master-computer, wiping not just human, but all life from the planet, restructuring it as his bio-mechanical domain. It’s not just the bleakness of its setting that makes the story so visceral, but also the vitriol with which it is infused: AM left five human beings alive for untold centuries, focusing all of his billions of terabytes of processing power beyond comprehension on inflicting pain upon his subjects. The hatred he feels towards them is so vivid, it could only come from a real place. No wonder the author – Harlan Ellison – played the role of AM in the video game adaptation.
There’s too much to unpack here. The story of the game – written by Ellison himself – completes the short story in ways so symbiotic, it is almost impossible to view them as separate entities. You could be forgiven to forget that Nimdok is only revealed to be Dr. Mengele’s assistant in the game. You could also be forgiven for missing the bulk of psychological and even philosophical subtext of this literary entity, if you had only read the book.
One day I hope to analyze this entity, for it remains, as many of the greats, a largely underappreciated work. The depth of its themes is rivaled only by its stylistic strength. It is rough, imperfect, flawed – sure. But if all flawed games would be this powerful, we wouldn’t need ones that are perfect in the first place.
