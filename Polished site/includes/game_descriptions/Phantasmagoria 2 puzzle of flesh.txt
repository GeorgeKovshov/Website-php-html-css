This one is going be controversial (which, I guess, goes with the territory). The general consensus (even from the people considering this game one of their favorites) is that this is one of those “so bad its good” FMV games from the late 90s. Which does make sense, as this game does ham-it-up quite a bit.
However! What those people fail to mention is how legit the psychological dynamics of its surprisingly ahead of the time plot (the representations of gay and bdsm relationships are quite modern) actually are. If you’d studied Freud, Lacan and Yung, in particular, you’ll found a ton of stuff to appreciate in this game, the “badness” of which is genuinely overrated. It’s, essentially, the video game equivalent of “Videodrome”. There are some spectacularly effective scenes here (like the ones in the therapist’s office), the eerie atmosphere is incredibly captivating (just notice the weirdness and “vibe” of the office here, for instance), the characters are interesting, etc. It’s a great game.
