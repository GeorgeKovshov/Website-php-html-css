Even though not as great as the previous entries, Silent Hill 4 is a very good game. It’s unique “Rear Window” meets “Jacob’s Ladder” concept alone is enough to justify the people who say that this game would have been much more successful if not associated to the Silent Hill series.
Personally, I think it fits right in: the psychological depth of its character exploration is rivaled only with the strength of its atmosphere. The imagery of SH4 is simply stunning – there are moments in this game that will stay with you for the rest of your life.
There are flaws in this game, although not as many as people tend to say (invincible enemies are excellent here – they are terrifying!), the DMC4 style backtracking in the latter half of the game being one of them: sure it’s a flaw on the surface, but, if you remove it from the game, the overall experience (and its meaning) would get lessened considerably.
All in all, it’s an excellent finale to an excellent run of the Japanese Silent Hill games.
