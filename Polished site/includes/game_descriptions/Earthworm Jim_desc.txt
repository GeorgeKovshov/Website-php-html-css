Earthworm Jim is, possibly, my favorite non-cinematic 2D platformer. It doesn't reach for the moon in terms of gameplay, but... My God, what a great presentation this game has. 
But it's more than that. Sequel to this game is, essentially, better in every way... yet there's something missing from it. That something is atmosphere. EJ1 is not just a funny little cartoony platformer. You see, somehow, with its array of levels, the way they flow into one another, the developers managed to infuse this game with a true sense of surreal place and universe. The closest I can come to describing it is: it's like the middle point between Nickelodeon cartoons, Heavy Metal magazine comics and Hylics games. While it may not reach the heights of each, the simple breadth of its stylistic power is so overpowering, that it manages to rival them in the same way Beatles can rival Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. 
There's a value in being many things at once, rather than something ultra-specific. As long as you're having as much fun with it as EJ1 does.
