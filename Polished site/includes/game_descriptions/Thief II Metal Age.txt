The pinnacle of first-person stealth-action gameplay that has proven itself being impossible to top. The levels of astonishing size and complexity with innumerable, immersion-sim levels of variability and design so excellent that I was able to finish this game (first playthrough) on the hardest difficulty with nothing but my complete attention and reasonable effort (the original, mind you, required the consultation of an faq).
… And that without even adding in one of the greatest settings the gaming ever seen. Thief 2 merges the dark steampunk with medieval fantasy and somehow makes it completely its own. The atmosphere of this game alone is a solid proof that the technical quality of presentation has no correlation to how vivid\authenthic\captivating the “feeling” of a world in a game is. Art direction affects atmosphere, not graphical fidelity – despite quite shockingly dated graphics, Thief 2 remains one of the most atmospheric games I’d played.
Add to that the legitimately excellent story that combines thematic complexity (which comes in great resonance with the first game – combined they actually achieve quite a literary level of thematic development) with believable and interesting characters (specifically the protagonist), great intrigue and payoff and you get… how many reasons to play this game so far? Any of the already given would qualify Thief 2 as a great game, and I’m probably forgetting a few.
