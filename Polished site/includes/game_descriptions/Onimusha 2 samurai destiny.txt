Taking the rock solid foundation from the original and polishing it up wasn’t enough for the developers of Onimusha 2, who created one wonderfully weird mix of an early Hack-&-Slash (the original Onimusha being the missing link between Resident Evil and Devil May Cry) and… a dating sim, for the lack of a better word.
It’s not uncommon to create branching paths in Survival Horror games that Onimusha takes roots from, however none shine such a bright light on that particular gameplay dynamic as Samurai’s Destiny. The whole first half of the game is structured around a town to which you return, Diablo-style, to spent money and items on… gifts to the characters that may or may not help you during the second half, when stuff starts happening.
The following experience of bonding and then seeing a story become tied to the characters you’d bonded to gets complimented with an excellently realized setting of Feudal Japan with its mythology coming to life. The somewhat deliberate gameplay is conducive to immersion, which this world is 100% deserving of. It’s flawed in many ways, but there’s not a game quite like this one out there.
