First Person Shooter is an action game, in which the challenge lies in lining up the target reticle (tied to the mouse look) with enemy targets. Enemies, in turn, move around (making them harder to hit) and try to damage you in return, meaning that you also have to dodge their attacks. This dodge and shoot gameplay formula proved to be the most successful variation on action in video games.
