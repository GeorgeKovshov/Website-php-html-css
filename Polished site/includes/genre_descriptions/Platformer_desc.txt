Platforming games are action titles that prioritize movement mechanics. They present the player with a situation/environment where the challenge is to traverse a treacherous pathway full of obstacles with the successful and timely controller input (usually involving the "jump" button). Name is derived from the most common obstacle in those games: narrow platforms across bottomless pits that you have to jump across.
