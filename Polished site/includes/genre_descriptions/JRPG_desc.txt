During the 80s the western developers were pushing RPGs in terms of further complicating their elaborate systems (no matter what you thought this sentence meant - you got it right), while the Japanese went the opposite way and tried to strip down the RPG to its essentials, polishing what was already well-established, rather than introduce something new. At first the difference between CRPG and JRPGs was only noticeable by aficionados, in the 90s and onward this trend became especially noticeable. Western games would produce incredibly ambitious, yet almost universally "flawed" titles, Japanese would retain even the most "old-school" features, like random encounters... but make them with astonishing level of craftsmanship. In essence, JRPG is the preference of tradition to ambition and polish to innovation. Japanese RPG is not necessarily has to be made in Japan - it just has to keep strongly to this tradition.
