Surprisingly misguided genre title. At its core, it is a variation on shooter gameplay, but with heavier controls and 360 degrees of combat periphery (Wing Commander a prime example). It doesn't have to be set in space (Aquanox). What's even more perplexing is that games like X and Elite also fall under this genre, even though they play more like Sid Meyer's Pirates than Wing Commander. Very misleading genre convention.
