Alternatively: "Slasher", "Character action", "Stylish action". It's an action game in which combat revolves around melee, being the 3D relative of a beat'em up. Many games of the kind, to supplement the lack of aim-and-shoot dynamic that defines skill of shooters, introduce a complex battle system with tons of attacks, combos and abilities. Even though immediate accurate input is easier than in shooters (it's hard to miss an enemy), it's made much harder to maintain that input over the course of a prolonged combo.
